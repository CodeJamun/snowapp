SKI APP
Users can search for Colorado Ski Resorts based on Name and can find out how high the resort goes! Colorado has an extensive list of resorts so the program narrows it down to the first couple of entries. Users can interact with the console with input from prompts.  This is a c# console based app that should run NET 5.0 well.  The features of the program are listed below. There are no special requirements to run this app.  There should be a program, resort, and park file for the user to download. Have fun!

Features: 

I created Resort and Park class that populates objects with the attributes Resort Name, ID, and Vertical Distance.  At the end of the program there is a log that record misc resorts that were not used in the program to an external text file on the user's D drive.   Several LINQ queries were used to populate data from the list of objects such as by letter or by distance.  There is also a conversion tool that converts feet to meters for those who are interested in European metrics. In the future, there would be a master loop with a weather API. Please ignore the LINQQuery and MENU files as they accidentally got uploaded.

Made in Visual Studio on MAC
